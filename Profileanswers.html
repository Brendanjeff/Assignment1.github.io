          What do the reuslts of these test mean for you?
      </p>

      <p style="text-align:center">
          For the most part, they mean very little to me. It was interesting to see what results the computer
        <br>
          gave me, considering that some of the limited answers I had to choose from werenâ€™t accurate to my
        <br>
          thinking or behaviours.
      </p>

      <p style="text-align:center;font-weight:bold;font-size:15pt">
          How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:center">
          I can not see these results influencing my behaviour in the slightest. Prior to these test, I was fully
        <br>
          aware that I am not the most creative person there is. In a team environment, I have no shame or
        <br>
          hesitation in putting my hand up and saying I am not the person to have in charge or dealing with
        <br>
          creative elements of a task or job.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:center;font-weight:bold;font-size:15pt">
          How should you take this into account when forming a team?
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:center">
          In regard to creativity and design etc, let the team know of my shortfall. I can do a number of things
        <br>
          and am happy to learn new things, however putting me in that role would be detrimental to
        <br>
          the overall success of the team completing the task/job required.
