      <h1 style=text-align:center>Job Description</h1>

      <p style="text-align:center;font-weight:bold;font-size:15pt">
          A description (in your own words) of the position, and particularly what makes this position appealing to you.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:center">This position will be with the ITS Cloud Technologies team which supports all of the internal IT
        <br>
          infrastructure that is used by company staff, including server, Cloud, Storage and data Centres.
        <br>
          This position particularly appeals to me as it is a broad skills position that doesnâ€™t just focus on one thing or platform.
      </p>

      <p style="text-align:center;font-weight:bold;font-size:15pt">
          A description (in your own words) of the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:center">This position requires a broad range of skills with the backing of foundational education. The need
        <br>
          for occupational experience with server environments, public cloud providers, API management and
        <br>
          virtual networking would see this position only suitable for someone who has, I would think, 5 years
        <br>
          to 10 years job experience in I.T with specific coverage of the listed role knowledge.
      </p>

      <p style="text-align:center;font-weight:bold;font-size:15pt">
          A description (in your own words) of the skills, qualifications and experience you currently have.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:center">My current skills within I.T are majority in house training on proprietary programs. I have basic
        <br>
          knowledge and skills in SQL, C++, Python and HTML which has all been self-taught through trial and
        <br>
          error, or through basic online (free) short courses.
      </p>

<p style="text-align:center;font-weight:bold;font-size:15pt">
          A plan describing how you will obtain the skills, qualifications and experience required for the
        <br>
          position, building on those you have now. This need not be greatly detailed, (and will probably
        <br>
          change significantly over time anyway), but try to be as specific as you can.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:center">My basic plan would be to successfully complete the Bachelor of I.T I am currently completing and
        <br>
          then use that, with my continuing experience in I.T to secure myself a role as a System Administrator
        <br>
          which will expose me to the vast majority of the systems and platforms required for such a role.
