        <p style="text-align:center">
          This project will be about creating a safe and secure internet experience for computers and devices
          <br>
          on my home local network through the use of a Raspberry Pi. The primary aim of this project will be
          <br>
          to ensure younger children do not accidentally find themselves looking and listening to content that
          <br>
          is inappropriate, dangerous, or both. This will be accomplished by specific site blacklisting, key
          <br>
          word/common term wildcard blocks, maturity ratings or any combination of the three. At the same
          <br>
          time, this project will also need to be able to provide a less restricted or unrestricted internet experience
          <br>
          for mature aged users.
