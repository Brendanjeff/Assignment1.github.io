          Overview
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:center">
          This project will be about creating a safe and secure internet experience for computers and devices
          <br>
          on my home local network through the use of a Raspberry Pi. The primary aim of this project will be
          <br>
          to ensure younger children do not accidentally find themselves looking and listening to content that
          <br>
          is inappropriate, dangerous, or both. This will be accomplished by specific site blacklisting, key
          <br>
          word/common term wildcard blocks, maturity ratings or any combination of the three. At the same
          <br>
          time, this project will also need to be able to provide a less restricted or unrestricted internet experience
          <br>
          for mature aged users.

          Motivation
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:center">
          This project will be, and is, useful to me as I have 2 young children who are steadily becoming better
          <br>
          and better with their written/spelling skills. There have been a number of occasions in recent times
          <br>
          when I have walked past my eldest child while he’s on his iPad, to discover he has yet again gone
          <br>
          ahead and downloaded or installed something other than requested last he asked for the parental
          <br>
          controls to be temporarily lifted. 99% of the time he has gone and installed a game that he has seen
          <br>
          an older child at afterschool care playing, has remembered the name, and managed to remember
          <br>
          enough of how it was spelled to get the auto spell correct to fill in the rest.

          Description
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:center">
          The features i will be focusing on implementing are:
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:center;font-weight:bold;font-size:12pt">
          •	Blocking/filter method
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:center">
          There are a few ways in which I could filter out content that I deem inappropriate for my
          <br>
          children. One could be by way of adding block lists. This is a quick way to add a lot of web
          <br>
          sites to the block list in one huge hit. Unfortunately, variations of a blocked site, or just a
          <br>
          new site with the same content can and will be up and running the next day. Because of
          <br>
          this, in addition to block lists, I will also be using keyword/common phrase wildcard blocks.
          <br>
          This should fill most of the gaps a broad spectrum URL block list will have as I can use simple
          <br>
          words or phrases like guns, blood, xxx or gambling to weed out sites that may pose a age
          <br>
          appropriate risk.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:center;font-weight:bold;font-size:12pt">
          •	Individual Restriction Levels
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:center">
          While the above filtering methods should provide adequate protection, it could seriously
          <br>
          dampen the experience for more mature users, like myself. Being unable to search or look
          <br>
          for computer games or movies due to the age restrictions or not being able to log into lotto
          <br>
          to check my numbers as examples, could quickly land this project in the bin. I will need to be
          <br>
          able to specify either which user ID’s, or which device ID’s, have content restrictions and to
          <br>
          what level. As well as this I will be looking to incorporate time and download limitations to
          <br>
          specific user/device ID’s. The main reason for this will be to ensure that children don’t try
          <br>
          and spend every waking hour glued to a device or blowing out download limits and clogging
          <br>
          up their devices.

          •	Internet Time and Download Restrictions
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:center">
          As well as individual content restrictions, I will also be looking to incorporate time and
          <br>
          download limitations to specific user/device ID’s. The main reason for this will be to ensure
          <br>
          that children don’t try and spend every waking hour glued to a device or blowing out
          <br>
          download limits and clogging up their devices. Specific downtimes during the day and
          <br>
          evening will be used to not only limit screen time and prevent any sneaky middle of the
          <br>
          night device usage, but to help promote daily routine. Having the internet down between
          <br>
          5pm and 7:30pm Monday to Friday as an example, can act as a starting point in
          <br>
          the afternoon for an evening routine for things like school work, showers, dinner and
          <br>
          preparation for the next day at school.

          •	Raspberry Pi
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:center">
          Further investigation on what device version will have sufficient specifications is required,
          <br>
          however it seems that something as simple as a Pi Zero will be sufficient for this task.

          •	Pi-Hole
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:center">
          This will be the base program used to implement the above-mentioned blocking/restrictions.

          •	My Home Network
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:center">
          This currently consists of 2 pc’s, NAS, 2 mobile phones, 4 tablets, 1 smart TV and a Nintendo
          <br>
          Switch.

          •	GitHub
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:center">
          There are a number of URL block lists available which will help form a good base level of site
          <br>
          protection, this will then be added to.

          Skills Required
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:center">
          It is highly likely I will need to gain an understanding and learn the basics of C/C++ as Pi-Hole is a
          <br>
          Linux application. Basic file movement and file editing will definitely be required for the proper setup
          <br>
          and feature changes I am intending to carry out. While Raspbian comes pre-loaded with Python, for
          <br>
          this project I am not sure that it will be used much, if at all, for the project. It could, however,
          <br>
          possibly be used to send an error message to the user in the event of a restricted site being
          <br>
          accessed.

          Outcome
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:center">
          Semi-automation.  The outcome for this project is to be able to provide a safe internet experience
          <br>
          for all users on my home local network. Something that can be set up, tweaked occasionally, but
          <br>
          ultimately just works. This will ideally be something that can be built upon and added to with
          <br>
          additional Raspberry Pi’s or other network items/systems as time goes on.
          <br>
          It will also serve as the beginning steppingstone into all things IoT when it comes to around the
          <br>
          home automation or fun little network or programming based jobs and hobbies.
