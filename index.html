          Hi all, I'm Brendan.
        <br>
          I am the eldest of four children born and raised in Australia with a Irish/English background.
        <br>
          English is my only fluent language. I am currently residing in glorious Queensland with my wife, 2 kids and a pony sized Bullmastiff X Dane called Archer.
        <br>
          I completed year 12, with a number of Cert’s also completed over the years, with the highest being a Cert IV.
        <br>
          In 2021, I took the leap and enrolled in a Bachelor of I.T degree.
        <br>
          Apart from building and maintaining home desktops, my current hobby is training and competing in local triathlons with a couple of close friends, the most recent
        <br>
          being in mid May 2021.
        <br>
          A little piece of life history about myself that some people find interesting is, I am a Veteran.
    </p>

  <h2 style=text-align:center>Where did my interest in I.T come from?</h2>
    <p style=text-align:center>My interest in IT was sparked when I my father came home one day with our first ever family computer.
        <br>
          I remember sitting next to him, glued to my chair watching him do the simplest of tasks, like typing, and being engrossed by it
        <br>
          because of how fast it was compared to writing. It wasn’t until I watched him take the covers off and replace the HDD that I was
        <br>
          truly hooked on computers, most notably the building side of it all, and have been building my own PC’s since then.
        <br>
        <br>
          I chose to study with RMIT as it was recommended to me by number of people, and I needed a 100% online option to be able to fit study
        <br>
          in with everything else going on in life.
        <br>
        <br>
          During my studies, I would expect to learn a broad range of skills that would see me as educated/qualified enough to successfully apply
        <br>
          for most generalised I.T roles in the workplace. I am particularly interested in the cloud based computing and networking components of the course.
