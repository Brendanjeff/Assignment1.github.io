  Hi all, I'm Brendan.<br>
  I am the eldest of four children born and raised in Australia with a Irish/English background.<br>
  English is my only fluent language. I am currently residing in glorious Queensland with my wife, 2 kids and a pony sized Bullmastiff X Dane called Archer.<br>
  I completed year 12, with a number of Certâ€™s also completed over the years, with the highest being a Cert IV.<br>
  In 2021, I took the leap and enrolled in a Bachelor of I.T degree.
  Apart from building and maintaining home desktops, my current hobby is training and competing in local triathlons with a couple of close friends, the most recent <br>
  being in mid May 2021.<br>
  A little piece of life history about myself that some people find interesting is, I am a Veteran.
